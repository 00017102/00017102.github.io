# README for Gayane Bakery Website

## Overview
This website was developed for Gayane Bakery (Торты от Гаянэ), situated in Tashkent at Chilanzar 6-37A. It was crafted as part of a coursework project for a Web Technology module. The site's features enable customers to order an array of baked items such as cakes, desserts, and cookies available at Gayane. Additionally, it provides comprehensive information about the bakery and its team. The design and functionality of the website are tailored to fulfill certain academic criteria and showcase web development expertise.

## Project details
The central aim of this project is to meet the requirements of a Web Technology module in university. This website serves as a demonstration of my skill in crafting a responsive and interactive online platform, independently developed without relying on pre-existing frameworks for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dynamic features include showcasing products on the main and menu pages, detailing staff members on the 'About Us' page, and displaying selected products in the shopping cart, all achieved using JavaScript. Classes such as "Staff", "Products", and "CartProduct" were utilized, with instances generated through arrays. Media queries were employed to ensure the site's responsiveness and aesthetic appeal on smaller screens. 

## Important Note
It's important to clarify that while Gayane Bakery is a real entity, this website is purely conceptual and not a representation of an actual business operation. Consequently, all information displayed on the site is fictional. This website was created to fulfill Web Technology module’s requirements and does not represent an actual company or service.
